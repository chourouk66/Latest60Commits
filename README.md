# Latest60Commits
Program can be called by running: node commits.js “user” “Auth”. 
Program reads all user's repos/commits and adds times of the most recent 60 commits to commits.csv. It also displays the mean time between these commits on the console.
Assuming user has at least 2 commits
Assuming user exists
Program looks at all user’s repositories/commits.
Unfortunately, I run out of time and unable to address Authentication
