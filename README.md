# Latest60Commits
Program can be called by running: node commits.js “user” “Auth”. 
Program reads all user's repos/commits and adds times of the most recent 60 commits to commits.csv. 
It also displays the mean time between these commits on the console (time is in milliseconds).
Assuming user has at least 2 commits
Assuming user exists
Program looks at all user’s repositories/commits.
Unfortunately, I run out of time and unable to address Authentication
