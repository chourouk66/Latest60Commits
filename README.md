# Latest60Commits
JavaScript Program can be called by running: node commits.js “user” “Auth”. 
Assuming user exists
Unfortunately, I run out of time and unable to address Authentication
"Auth" param is not required as Authentication/token has not been implemented.
Program pulls all user's repos/commits from GitHub and adds times of the most recent 60 commits to commits.csv. 
It also displays the mean time between these commits on the console (time is in hours).
Assuming user has at least 2 commits
Program looks at all user’s repositories/commits.
